## About The Project
![BattleCell Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

BattleCell is a small project which I'm building for my Uni Course called _Computer Games_.

The game falls into the Strategy/AutoChess category, where the player can pick their character and their defensive traits and let them loose on the opposing players. No teams. No truces. Just an all out brawl!

This game is built using [JUMG](https://github.com/TheBrenny/JUMG-3.0), a side project that will help me build more games in the future, because doing that is fun!

## Playing the Game
To play the game, you'll need to have at least Java 8 installed. From there, download the jar file from the [releases page](https://github.com/TheBrenny/BattleCell/releases)

### Modify the Code
`git clone` this repo and open it up in VSCode or Eclipse!

## Roadmap
See the [open issues](https://github.com/TheBrenny/BattleCell/issues) for a list of known issues.
